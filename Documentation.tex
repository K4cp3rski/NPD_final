\subsection{\texttt{download.py}}
\subsubsection{\texttt{get\_sheet\_links\_names}}
This functions is fitted to crawl and return implicit links and names of the \verb|.xlsx| files from the  \href{https://www.gov.pl/web/finanse/udzialy-za-2020-r}{government stat website} used in this program.\\ \\
The function's inner working:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Keyword arguments:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|year|, default value: 2019. This kwarg is responsible for choosing which year you want to download the files from. It is a simplified application, only restricted to scope of this program, because only sites with data for 2019 and 2020 have so similar urls.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Procedure:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The procedure crawls webpage and collects all html segments containing href links
        \item Then we cut this list looking for our characterically-shaped file links (36-character coded), as only 5 of those are among the links
        \item Lastly we parse for according names, as we need those for saving the downloaded \verb|.xlsx| files.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
